        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
            My interest lies in software engineering, which I am actively pursuing opportunities in.
            Driven by a desire to help others, I get excited by experiences where I would be able to make a real positive impact.
            Below you can find some tools/technologies that I have worked with in the past, however my greatest skill is not these languages, 
            but rather my ability to use them to solve problems! You can check out some of the stuff I've worked on through my

          <h3>UCSD Translational Ultrasound Lab</h3>
          <p>I am currently working as a software developer at the Translational Ultrasound Lab where I am developing QuantUS,
          an open-source Quantitative Ultrasound analysis toolkit. QuantUS is built using Python and follows a plugin-based 
          architecture. My work has given me experience in full-stack development, including backend data processing, 
          GUI development, and designing modular, plugin-based systems for scientific software.

          <h3>Devcon Construction</h3>
          <p>As an intern at Devcon, I developed automation systems and AI-powered tools to help employees speed up their workflows.
          I worked on end-to-end systems using Python, Flask, and Azure while gaining hands-on experience with identifying 
          company needs, planning scalable solutions, and deploying real-world software. My time at Devcon taught me a lot about
          automation, AI-integration, and software development in industry.

          <h3>Elegant Mind Club UCLA</h3>
          <p>During my time at Professor Katsushi Arisaka's lab, aka the Elegant Mind Club, I worked on a team as part of project
          TERESA - Teleported Reality Surgical AI. My role involved development on a robotic arm built for precise surgical 
          applications. I worked on embedded code in C and C++ for the arm, as well as simulation software for a computer 
          visualization of it using Python. The goal was to use this simulation to aid in training AI tools for controlling the 
          robot.

          <h3>HYEL</h3>
          <p>I previously led a small team on a game development project for a startup app called HYEL. HYEL is a mobile app featuring a 
          variety of games that users can have fun with and compete with their friends. My team's game was called Ocean Explorers,
          inspired by the classic game Crossy Road. This experience taught me a lot about software development as my team and I went
          through the full development lifecycle, including designing, coding, testing, and everything in between.

          <h3>De Anza Computer Lab</h3>
          <p>I also previously spent time as an intern at De Anza College's Computer Lab, in which I worked on getting used computers
          ready for student use in order to give disadvantaged students access to the technology they needed. My tasks included 
          wiping computers, configuring new operating systems, and troubleshooting to identify and resolve issues pertaining to 
          both software and hardware.
